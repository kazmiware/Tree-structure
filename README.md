# Tree-structure
This project will create a tree data structure in python
First i created a class called Tree and gave following attributes to it
1.Parent
2.*child
The parent attribute is  the name of the parent the child is going to belong to you can also say that ot is an ancestor of the child
*child is similar to using *args and is the list of childs of each parent
The only function in the class is printing the tree and  in the function we will be first printing the parent name oo level 0 and the by using a for loop we will iterate through
the child list of that parent and then we will print the name of that child and again iterate through the child list of this parent and so on
